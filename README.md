# Parametric Picture Frame

Here's a picture frame for small artwork.

Dimensions are driven from these main parameters:

- Artwork width (mm)
- Artwork height
- Artwork thickness
- Glass thickness (default is American standard, 3/32 in)
- Matte overlap
- Matte width

I just picked a molding profile I liked, but of course you can change
that by modifying the profile sketch.

Generates separate objects for printing:

- Frame
- Mounting matte with beveled edge
- Backing material
- Shims to secure everything

Artwork purchased at the [East Bay Print
Sale](https://www.eastbayprintsale.com/) on December 6, 2024. I regret I do not
know who the artist is! In addition to the mark on the front, the back was
inscribed with the code "EBAR96".
